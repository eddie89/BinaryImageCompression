This project contains the four picture compression techniques Graph Based Decomposition,
Quadtree Decomposition, Constant Bit-Length Quadtree Decomposition and Generalized Delta Method.

The result pictures are saved into the resultPictures directory.

Also the libraries edu.princeton.cs.algs4 and com.sun.pkg.util need to be imported into the project, to be 
able to run all algorithms properly.
